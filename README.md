I'm Gavin ðŸ‘‹  I like to create intuitive and accessible experiences for the web, both for money and for fun (ideally, it's both!)

I have over a decade of experience developing both enterprise web applications and websites.  I enjoy using TypeScript and most JavaScript libraries and frameworks not named Angular.  I have a passion for the web and creating places that make someone's experience on the internet as enjoyable and usable as possible.
