I'm Gavin ðŸ‘‹  I like to create intuitive and accessible experiences for the web.

I have over a decade of experience developing both enterprise web applications and websites, and have a passion for the web and creating places and spaces that make everyone's experience on the internet as enjoyable and usable as possible.
